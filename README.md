# Car Purchase Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict the total dollar amount that customers are willing to pay for a car. The prediction is based on various customer attributes, including name, email, country, gender, age, annual salary, credit card debt, and net worth.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model contains the following attributes:

- Customer Name
- Customer E-mail
- Country
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Salary
- Credit Card Debt
- Net Worth
- Car Purchase Amount (Target Variable)

## Model Architecture

The machine learning model is built using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The architecture includes input layers corresponding to each attribute, hidden layers for feature extraction, and an output layer predicting the car purchase amount.
